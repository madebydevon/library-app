# Library

Hi there, this is a Library app created for the Odin Project curriculum.

# Features
1. Create and delete books
2. Change read status of a book
3. Display information about the book

# Why did I make this app?
I created this app because it is some practice of JavaScript for me, I learned a lot about objects and object constructors in this process of developing the app. Besides that I've also learnt more about JavaScript and I'm finding it quite enjoyable.
